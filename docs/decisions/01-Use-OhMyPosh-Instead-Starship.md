# 01. Use OhMyPosh instead Starship

- Starship do not feel mature enough in terms of functionalities it offers and needs a few more years of development to consider it a possible choice in my case.
- OMP integrates well with Nushell and have a lot of available plugins and themes that can be adopted - also there are are much more examples and documentation how to acomplish things.
