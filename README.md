# Unnecessary Dotfiles

Repository that contains cuts of my configurations from at least six different machines and ideas,
it's highly advised to use any of thoseâ€”by the end of 2024 I think everything will be rewritten into NixOS.

Configuration is based on [Hyprland]() to which I've jumped by pure accident to see if really [Nvidia]() is a real problem there (and overall speaking of [Wayland]()) - as things we're working on first-shot with [CachyOS]() I've decided to move up from [Gnome]() to Hyprland an it feels like a good choice.

*By "running with Nvidia" I mean: AMD Ryzen 9 7950X have integrated graphics which is used for system, and the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 is used only for CUDA and OpenCL tasks with `nvidia-prime` approach.*

## Features

- Awful as hell, do not worry this will not look better (talking these about mismatched colours, misaligned icons and missing half of the features that you have in GNOME - but at least here are animations, not that they could not exist in gnome but...)
- `carapace`-based completions that either are not complete, miss-integrated or just doesn't work at all. Featuring `fish`-completions that are not working at all and `inshellisense` that just ruins everything.
- `nushell` as default shell to make life more complicated.
- `kitty` as terminal emulator with artistic artifacts as true **NVIDIA Experience** (TM).
- `helix` as modal editor, to make vim users mad.


## Themes

I always prefer to have multiple themes for different moods, the one usually I go with is `Sakura` however, recently I decided to switch to `Evergreen` for a while and in terms of `Cypherpunk` when I was using `nord` and `tokyo-night` I never matched it "correctly" with anything so I would say it's last preference.

- [`Evergreen`](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest), the calm composition made on color of the forest. ([`miasma`](https://github.com/xero/miasma.nvim))
- [`Sakura`](https://rosepinetheme.com/),  All natural pine, faux fur and a bit of soho vibes for the classy minimalist.
- [`Cypherpunk`](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim), dark composition made with dark indigo and neon-like colors.

| **Shell**             | [`nushell`](./home/dot_config/nushell/README.md) | Nushell isn't mean to be used as login shell due to lack of POSIX compliance, however it's friendly shell that can be used as default in terminal. |
